         Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic) is an international computer-based
         English language test. It provides a measure of a test taker’s language ability in order to
         assist education institutions and professional and government organizations that require a
         standard of academic English language proficiency for admission purposes.

         The Score Guide is designed for anyone who wants to learn more about how the different
         tasks in PTE Academic are scored. The Guide will help you to understand:
               What test takers are assessed on
               How to use scores reported on the score report
               How to compare PTE Academic scores with scores on other English language tests
               How automated scoring operates

         The Guide has been bookmarked and linked so that you can access sections quickly from

         the ‘Contents’ page and dip into the topics you want to know more about.

         PTE Academic reports an overall score, communicative skills scores and enabling skills
         scores.














































         Overall score


         The overall score is based on performance on all test items (tasks in the test consisting of
         instructions, questions or prompts, answer opportunities and scoring rules). Each test taker
         does between 70 and 91 items in any given test and there are 20 different item types. For
         each item, the score given contributes to the overall score. The score range is 10–90 points.




         Communicative skills scores

         The communicative skills measured are listening, reading, speaking and writing. Items

         testing these communicative skills also test specific subskills. For integrated skills items (that
         is, those assessing reading and speaking, listening and speaking, reading and writing,
         listening and writing, or listening and reading) the item score contributes to the score for
         the communicative skills that the item assesses. The score range for each skill is 10–90
         points.




         Version 9/ March 2018                                                                                5]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Enabling skills scores


         The enabling skills are used to rate performance in the productive skills of speaking and
         writing. The enabling skills measured are grammar, oral fluency, pronunciation, spelling,
         vocabulary, and written discourse. The scores for enabling skills are based on
         performance on only those items that assess these skills specifically. The score range for
         each skill is 10–90 points.

         The enabling skills reported are described as follows:

         Grammar                Correct use of language with respect to word form and word order at the
                                sentence level.
         Oral fluency           Smooth, effortless and natural-paced delivery of speech.
         Pronunciation          Production of speech sounds in a way that is easily understandable to
                                most regular speakers of the language. Regional or national varieties of
                                English pronunciation are considered correct to the degree that they are
                                easily understandable to most regular speakers of the language.
         Spelling               Writing of words according to the spelling rules of the language. All
                                national variations are considered correct, but one spelling convention
                                should be used consistently in a given response.
         Vocabulary             Appropriate choice of words used to express meaning, as well as lexical
                                range.
         Written discourse      Correct and communicatively efficient production of written language at
                                the textual level. Written discourse skills are represented in the structure
                                of a written text, its internal coherence, logical development and the
                                range of linguistic resources used to express meaning precisely.

         Scores for enabling skills are not awarded when responses are inappropriate for the items
         in either content or form. For example, if an essay task requires the test taker to discuss the
         environment, but the test taker’s response is entirely devoted to the topic of fashion or
         sport, no score points will be given for the response, and none of the enabling skills be
         scored for the item.

         In relation to form, if a task requires a one-sentence summary of a text and the response
         consists of a list of words, no score points for the response will be given.

         All items in PTE Academic are machine scored. Scores for some item types are based on
         correctness alone, while others are based on correctness, formal aspects and the quality of
         the response.

         Formal aspects refer to the form of the response: for example, whether it is over or under
         the word limit for a particular item type. The quality of the response is represented in the
         enabling skills. For example, in the item type Re-tell lecture the response is scored on skills
         such as oral fluency and pronunciation.

         Scores for item types assessing speaking and writing skills are generated by automated
         scoring systems. There are two types of scoring:




         Correct or incorrect


         Some item types are scored as either correct or incorrect. If responses are correct, a score
         of 1 score point will be given, but if they are incorrect, no score points are awarded.




         Partial credit


         Other item types are scored as correct, partially correct or incorrect. If responses to these
         items are correct, the maximum score points available for each item type will be received,
         but if they are partly correct, some score points will be given, but less than the maximum
         available for the item type. If responses are incorrect, no score points will be received.

         The tables that follow give an overview of how the 20 item types in the three parts of PTE
         Academic are scored. They also show timings, the number of items in any given test, the
         communicative skills, enabling skills and other elements scored.

         Please note: The minimum and maximum timings indicated for the sections of each part of
         the test do not add up to the total timings stated. This is because different versions of the
         test are balanced for total length. No test taker will get the maximum or minimum times
         indicated.

         Example of item scoring
         The diagram below illustrates how different types of scores reported in the PTE Academic
         score report are computed for the item type Write essay.







         Version 9/ March 2018                                                                                9]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[The item type is rated on content; form; vocabulary; spelling; grammar; development,
         structure and coherence; and general linguistic range.

         The item is first scored on content. If no response or an irrelevant response is given, the
         content is scored as 0.

         If an acceptable response is provided (a score is received for content), the item will be
         scored on form. If the response is of the appropriate length, a score will be given and the
         response will then be rated on the remaining traits: vocabulary, spelling, grammar;
         development, structure and coherence; and general linguistic range.

         The scores for content, form and the enabling skills traits (vocabulary, spelling, grammar,
         development, structure and coherence, and general linguistic range) add up to the total
         item score.

         The enabling skills scores awarded for the item contribute to the enabling skills scores

         reported for performance on the entire test, which for this particular item type include
         vocabulary, spelling, grammar and written discourse.

         The total item score contributes to the communicative skills score for writing, as well as to
         the overall score reported for performance on the entire test.

         The following scoring criteria apply to the speaking item types that are scored on
         pronunciation and oral fluency in PTE Academic.

         Pronunciation
         5 Native-like         All vowels and consonants are produced in a manner that is easily
                               understood by regular speakers of the language. The speaker uses
                               assimilation and deletions appropriate to continuous speech. Stress is
                               placed correctly in all words and sentence-level stress is fully appropriate
         4 Advanced            Vowels and consonants are pronounced clearly and unambiguously. A few
                               minor consonant, vowel or stress distortions do not affect intelligibility. All
                               words are easily understandable. A few consonants or consonant sequences
                               may be distorted. Stress is placed correctly on all common words, and
                               sentence level stress is reasonable
         3 Good                Most vowels and consonants are pronounced correctly. Some consistent
                               errors might make a few words unclear. A few consonants in certain
                               contexts may be regularly distorted, omitted or mispronounced. Stress-
                               dependent vowel reduction may occur on a few words
         2 Intermediate        Some consonants and vowels are consistently mispronounced in a non-
                               native like manner. At least 2/3 of speech is intelligible, but listeners might
                               need to adjust to the accent. Some consonants are regularly omitted, and
                               consonant sequences may be simplified. Stress may be placed incorrectly on
                               some words or be unclear
         1 Intrusive           Many consonants and vowels are mispronounced, resulting in a strong
                               intrusive foreign accent. Listeners may have difficulty understanding about
                               1/3 of the words. Many consonants may be distorted or omitted. Consonant
                               sequences may be non-English. Stress is placed in a non-English manner;
                               unstressed words may be reduced or omitted and a few syllables added or
                               missed
         0 Non-English         Pronunciation seems completely characteristic of another language. Many
                               consonants and vowels are mispronounced, misordered or omitted.
                               Listeners may find more than 1/2 of the speech unintelligible. Stressed and
                               unstressed syllables are realized in a non-English manner. Several words
                               may have the wrong number of syllables
         Oral fluency
         5 Native–like         Speech shows smooth rhythm and phrasing. There are no hesitations,
                               repetitions, false starts or non-native phonological simplifications

         4 Advanced            Speech has an acceptable rhythm with appropriate phrasing and word
                               emphasis. There is no more than one hesitation, one repetition or a false
                               start. There are no significant non-native phonological simplifications
         3 Good                Speech is at an acceptable speed but may be uneven. There may be more
                               than one hesitation, but most words are spoken in continuous phrases.
                               There are few repetitions or false starts. There are no long pauses and
                               speech does not sound staccato
         2 Intermediate        Speech may be uneven or staccato. Speech (if >= 6 words) has at least one
                               smooth three-word run, and no more than two or three hesitations,
                               repetitions or false starts. There may be one long pause, but not two or
                               more

         responses. So if a test taker scores 2 points for two correct options, but then scores -2 for
         two incorrect options chosen, they will score 0 points overall for the item.

         PTE Academic uses 20 item types, reflecting different modes of language use and requiring
         different response tasks and formats. All items in PTE Academic are machine scored. Scores
         on a number of item types are based on correctness only, while scores on other item types
         requiring spoken or written responses are based, in addition to correctness, on formal
         aspects (e.g., number of words) and the quality of the response. The quality of the
         responses is reflected on the PTE Academic score report in the enabling skills: grammar,
         oral fluency, pronunciation, spelling, vocabulary and written discourse.




         How institutions can use PTE Academic scores





         Overall score and communicative skills scores


         The score report provides an overall score, a score for each communicative skill and a score
         for each of the enabling skills.

         The overall score provides a general measure of a test taker’s ability to deal with English in
         academic settings. The score range is from 10 to 90 points.

         The communicative skills scores provide discrete information about the listening, reading,
         speaking and writing skills of a test taker. These skills are also scored between 10 and 90
         points.

         In the context of some university programs, the communicative skills scores may provide
         useful, additional information for making admissions decisions.

         For example, institutions may:
         Set the admission requirement based on the minimum overall score alone, without taking
         into account communicative skills scores in admission decisions;

         Set the admission requirement based on the minimum overall score in combination with a
         higher minimum on one of the communicative skills scores, because it is considered
         particularly important for the program the test taker wants to enter;

         Set the admission requirement based on the minimum overall score in combination with a
         lower minimum on one of the communicative skills scores, because it is considered less
         important for the program the test taker wants to enter.


         Other combinations of the overall score and one or more of the communicative skills scores
         may be considered.

         The enabling skills scores are also provided within the PTE Academic score report. They
         provide information about particular strengths and weaknesses of a test taker’s ability to
         communicate in speaking or writing. This information may be useful to determine the type
         of further English study and coursework required to improve a test taker’s English language
         ability. The enabling skills scores should not be used when making admissions decisions
         because the ‘measurement error’ is too large. This is discussed in the ‘Error of
         measurement’ section on page 48.

         A definition of the enabling skills is given in the table below:

         To ensure comparability and interpretability of test scores, PTE Academic has been aligned
         to the CEF, which is recognized as a standard across Europe and in many countries outside
         of Europe. In the USA, the National Council of State Supervisors for Languages (NCSSFL) has
         introduced the use of the LinguaFolio Self-Assessment Grid (NCSSFL, 2008), which relates
         language levels to the scales of both the ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of
         Foreign Languages) and the CEF.

         The CEF includes a set of consecutive language levels defined by descriptors of language
         competencies. The six-level framework was developed by the Council of Europe (2001) to
         enable language learners, teachers, universities or potential employers to compare and
         relate language qualifications by level.

         Alignment of PTE Academic to the CEF levels provides a means to interpret PTE Academic
         scores in terms of the level descriptors of the CEF. As these descriptors focus on what an
         English language learner can do, scores that are properly aligned to the CEF give educators
         and institutions more relevant information about a test taker’s ability.




         The PTE Academic Score Scale and the CEF


         The explanation of the alignment of PTE Academic to the CEF is that to stand a reasonable
         chance at successfully performing any of the tasks defined at a particular CEF level, learners
         must be able to demonstrate that they can do the average tasks at that level.

         As students grow in ability, for example within the B1 level, they will become successful at
         doing even the most difficult tasks at that level and will also find they can cope with the
         easiest tasks at the next level. In other words, they are entering into the B2 level.

         The diagram below shows PTE Academic scores aligned to the CEF levels A2 to C2. The
         dotted lines on the scale show the PTE Academic score ranges that predict that test takers
         are likely to perform successfully on the easiest tasks at the next higher level. For example,

         if a candidate scores 51 on PTE Academic, this means that they are likely to be able to cope
         with the more difficult tasks within the CEF B1 level. At the same time, according to their PTE
         Academic score, it predicts that they are likely to perform successfully on the easiest tasks at
         B2.





















         Version 9/ March 2018                                                                                43]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[Alignment of PTE Academic scores to the CEF



         What PTE Academic scores mean


         PTE Academic alignment with the CEF can only be fully understood if it is supported with
         information showing what it really means to be ‘at a level’. In other words, are test takers
         likely to be successful with tasks at the lower boundary of a level; do they stand a fair
         chance of doing well on any task, or will they be able to do almost all the tasks, even the
         most difficult ones, at a particular level? The table below shows for each of the CEF levels A2
         to C2 which PTE Academic scores predict the likelihood of a test taker performing
         successfully on the easiest, average and most difficult tasks within each of the CEF levels.

         performance on CEF level tasks

         C1                        67                       76                        84
         B2                        51                       59                        75
         B1                        36                       43                        58
         A2                        24                       30                        42

         For example, if a test taker’s PTE Academic score is 36, this predicts that they will perform
         successfully on the easiest tasks at B1. From 36 to 43, the likelihood of successfully

         performing the easiest tasks develops into doing well on the average tasks at B1. Finally,
         reaching 58 predicts that a candidate will perform well at the most difficult B1 level tasks.

         the range from A1 to C1 mean. The table includes shaded score ranges that predict some
         degree of performance at the next higher level, and it describes what a test taker is likely to
         be able to do within those score ranges.

         PTE A scores, CEF level descriptors and what scores mean



         Error of measurement


         Tests aim to provide a measure of ability. PTE Academic measures the ability ‘to use English
         in academic settings’. Obviously, measures of a test taker’s English language abilities will
         vary; some candidates will have higher scores than others. The degree to which scores
         among test takers vary is the ‘score variance’. The purpose of testing is to measure ‘true
         variance’ in ability among students, but all measurement contains some error.

         The degree to which the score variance is due to error is called the ‘error of measurement’.
         The remainder of the variance is due to ‘true variance’ in ability among test takers. The error
         of measurement is related to the reliability of the test: a smaller measurement error means
         higher reliability of test scores.

         The error of measurement can be interpreted as follows: the true score of a test taker is
         within a range of scores around the reported score. The size of that range is defined by the
         error of measurement. For example, if the reported score is 60 and the error of
         measurement is 3, then the true score, with 68% certainty, is within one measurement error
         from the reported score; that is within the range of 57 (60-3) and 63 (60+3). The true score,
         with 95% certainty, is within twice the measurement error; that is within the range of 54 (60-
         2x3) to 66 (60+2x3).




         Overall score and communicative skills scores


         There are two main approaches to estimating the error of measurement. In Classical Test
         Theory (CTT) the reliability estimate is assumed to apply to any score on a test, irrespective
         of whether the score is low, medium or high. Therefore, the error of measurement is
         assumed to be the same size anywhere on the test’s score scale. That is why in CTT we
         speak of the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM). Many test providers report the SEM and
         for PTE Academic this is 2.32. This figure is based on test data from 30,000 test takers.

         An alternative approach to estimating the error of measurement is used in modern test
         theory, commonly referred to as Item Response Theory (IRT). IRT recognizes that the

         reliability of a test is not uniform across an entire score scale. Tests tend to be less reliable
         towards the extreme low and high score ranges. Consequently, the size of the error of
         measurement tends to be larger towards these extreme scores. The size of the error is

         Measurement (CEM).

         the overall score and for the communicative skills scores that are provided on the PTE
         Academic score report. The size of the error at each score point is estimated by averaging
         scores across a random sample of 100 test forms from the PTE Academic item bank.

         Test reliability


         Directly related to measurement error is test reliability, which is another way of expressing
         the likelihood that test results will be the same when a test is taken again under the same
         conditions, and therefore how accurately a reported test score reflects the true ability of the
         test taker.

                Academic, TOEFL and IELTS






         Test comparisons using field test data

         PTE Academic has been field tested using over 10,400 test takers. Field testing took place in

         2007 and 2008. Test takers were representative of the global population of students seeking
         admission to universities and other tertiary education institutions where English is the
         language of instruction. Test takers were born in 158 different countries and spoke 126
         different languages.

         During the field tests several sets of secondary data were collected. Among these were
         ratings for all test takers on descriptive scales published by the Council of Europe (2001). In
         addition, a number of test takers reported their scores on other tests of English, including
         TOEIC, TOEFL PBT, TOEFL CBT, TOEFL iBT and IELTS.

         A limited number of the self-reported data were invalid as the reported scores were outside
         the possible score range for the particular test. A small number of the test takers also
         submitted copies of their official score reports on the tests, for which they had provided
         self-reported data. The table below shows the following for each test: the numbers of self-
         reported data, how many of these were valid, the mean self-reported scores, the number of
         official score reports sent in, the mean official scores and the correlations with the PTE
                                                                                  2

         From the table, it can be concluded that the self-reported scores are, in general, quite
         accurate. Indeed, the correlation between the self-reported results and the official score
         reports was .82 for TOEFL iBT and .89 for IELTS. This finding is in agreement with earlier
         research on self-reported data. For example, Cassady (2001) found students’ self-reported
         Grade Point Average (GPA) scores to be ‘remarkably similar’ to official records. The data are
         also consistent. According to ETS (2005, p.7) the score range 75–95 on TOEFL iBT is

         TOEFL PBT. The mean self-reported scores in the table for these three tests are therefore
         comparable.

         In addition, according to ETS (2001, p.3) a score range of 800–850 on TOEIC corresponds to a
         score range of 569–588 on TOEFL PBT, which makes the self-reported TOEIC mean score of

         Based on the data presented in the table, concordance between PTE Academic and other
         tests of English can be estimated, taking into account a less than optimal effort of test takers
         during field testing where test results have no direct relevance to the test takers.




         Information on concordances since the launch of PTE

         Academic


         At the time of the launch of PTE Academic in November 2009 we presented concordance of
         PTE Academic with other measures of English as ‘preliminary’. Since then additional
         information has become available supporting our preliminary estimates. This new
         information comes from:
               the tens of thousands of test takers who have taken PTE Academic annually since
                launch
               the use of test scores by thousands of tertiary education institutions
               additional concordance data gathered via surveys
               publications by third parties




         Relation to the Common European Framework


         The relation of the PTE Academic score scale with the descriptive scale of the Common
         European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEF) is based on both an item-centered
         and a test taker-centered method. For the item-centered method, the CEF level of all items
         was estimated by item writers, reviewed and, if necessary, adapted in the item-reviewing
         process. For the test taker-centered method, three extended responses (one written and
         two spoken) per test taker were each rated by two independent, trained raters. If there was
         a disagreement between the two independent raters, a third rating was gathered and the
         two closest ratings were retained. A dataset of over 26,000 ratings (by test takers self-
         reporting, by items and by raters) on up to 100 different items was analyzed using the
         computer program FACETS (Linacre, 1988; 2005). Estimates of the lower boundaries of the
         CEF levels, based on the item-centered method, correlated at .996 with those based on the
         test taker-centered method, which effectively means that the two methods yielded the same
         results except for less than 1% of error variance.

         In addition to the initial field testing of 10,400 students during 2007–08, a further 364 test
         takers participated in the 2009 BETA testing of PTE Academic. The concordance between the
         score scale of PTE Academic and the score scales of TOEFL iBT and IELTS (each estimated
         from the field test data) were used as predictors of TOEFL iBT and IELTS scores of test takers
         participating in BETA testing. Test takers provided self-reported scores and a smaller,
         partially overlapping, number of test takers sent in copies of their official score reports.

         The table below shows the mean scores as self-reported and from the official score reports;
         the mean scores for the same test takers as predicted from their PTE Academic score and

         English


         Based on the research described, Pearson has produced concordance tables. The table on
         page 54 shows Pearson’s current best estimate of concordance between PTE Academic
         scores and the CEF. In addition, shaded score ranges indicate the PTE Academic scores that
         predict some degree of performance at the next CEF level.

         The table on page 57 shows the relation between scores on TOEFL iBT and PTE Academic.

         The table on page 58 shows the relation between scores on IELTS and PTE Academic.

         It must be noted that any attempt to predict a score on a particular test, based on the score
         observed on another test, will contain measurement error. This is caused by the inherent
         error in each of the tests in the comparison and in the estimate of the concordance.
         Furthermore, tests in the comparison do not measure exactly the same construct.












         3  Significant at p<.01 means there is less than 1% chance to observe this correlation if the measures are not related.

         Automated scoring


         As the worldwide leader in publishing and assessment for education, Pearson is using
         several of its proprietary, patented technologies to automatically score test takers’
         performance on PTE Academic. Academic institutions, corporations and government
         agencies around the world have selected Pearson’s automated scoring technologies to
         measure the abilities of students, staff or applicants. Pearson customers using automated
         spoken and written assessments include eight of the 2008 Fortune Top 20 companies; 11 of
         the 2008 Top 15 Indian BPO companies; the U.S., German and Dutch governments; world
         sports organizations, such as FIFA (organizers of the World Cup) and the Asian Games;
         major airlines and aviation schools; and leading universities and language schools.


         An extensive field test program was conducted to test PTE Academic’s test items and
         evaluate their effectiveness as well as to obtain the data necessary to train the automated
         scoring engines to evaluate PTE Academic items. Test data was collected from more than
         10,000 test takers from 38 cities in 21 countries who participated in PTE Academic’s field
         test. These test takers came from 158 different countries and spoke 126 different native
         languages, including (but not limited to) Cantonese, French, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi,
         Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Marathi, Polish, Spanish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Tamil,
         Telugu, Thai and Turkish. The data from the field test were used to train the automated
         scoring engines for both the written and spoken PTE Academic items.

         By combining the power of a comprehensive field test, in-depth research and Pearson’s
         proven, proprietary automated scoring technologies, PTE Academic fills a critical gap by
         providing a state-of-the-art test that accurately measures the English language speaking,
         listening, reading and writing abilities of non-native speakers.




         Scoring written English skills


         The written portion of PTE Academic is scored using the Intelligent Essay Assessor™ (IEA), an
         automated scoring tool that is powered by Pearson’s state-of-the-art Knowledge Analysis
         Technologies™ (KAT™) engine. Based on more than 20 years of research and development,
         the KAT engine automatically evaluates the meaning of text by examining whole passages.
         The KAT engine evaluates writing as accurately as skilled human raters using a proprietary
         application of the mathematical approach known as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Using
         LSA (an approach that generates semantic similarity of words and passages by analyzing
         large bodies of relevant text) the KAT engine “understands” the meaning of text much the
         same as a human does.

         detectors for off-topic responses or other situations that may need to be referred to human
         readers. Research conducted by independent researchers as well as Pearson supports IEA’s
         reliability for assessing knowledge and knowledge-based reasoning. IEA was developed
         more than a decade ago and has been used to evaluate millions of essays, from scoring
         student writing at elementary, secondary and university level, to assessing military
         leadership skills.




         Scoring spoken English skills


         The spoken portion of PTE Academic is automatically scored using Pearson’s Ordinate
         technology. Ordinate technology is the result of years of research in speech recognition,
         statistical modeling, linguistics and testing theory. The technology uses a proprietary speech
         processing system that is specifically designed to analyze and automatically score speech
         from native and non-native speakers of English. In addition to recognizing words, the
         system locates and evaluates relevant segments, syllables and phrases in speech and then
         uses statistical modeling technologies to assess spoken performance.

         To understand the way that the Ordinate technology is “taught” to score spoken language,
         think about a person being trained by an expert rater to score speech samples during
         interviews. First, the expert rater gives the trainee rater a list of things to listen for in the test
         taker’s speech during the interview. Then the trainee observes the expert testing numerous
         test takers, and, after each interview, the expert shares with the trainee the score he or she
         gave the test taker and the characteristics of the performance that led to that score. Over
         several dozen interviews, the trainee’s scores begin to look very similar to the expert rater’s
         scores. Ultimately, one could predict the score the trainee would give a particular test taker
         based on the score that the expert gave.


         This, in effect, is how the machine is trained to score, only instead of one expert teaching
         the trainee, there are many expert scorers feeding scores into the system for each
         response, and instead of a few dozen test takers, the system is trained on thousands of
         responses from hundreds of test takers. Furthermore, the machine does not need to be told
         what features of the speech are important; the relevant features and their relative
         contributions are statistically extracted from the massive set of data when the system is
         optimized to predict human scores.

         Ordinate technology powers the Versant™ line of language assessments, which are used by
         organizations such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, schools of aviation
         around the world, the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the Netherlands, and the
         U.S. Department of Education. Independent studies have demonstrated that Ordinate’s
         automated scoring system can be more objective and more reliable than many of today’s
         best human-rated tests, including one-on-one oral proficiency interviews.

         The PTE Academic automated scoring system correlates highly with human ratings. Studies
         have been carried out to compare human and machine scores for the speaking item type
         Describe image using tasks such as the example below.




         Example Describe image item






















         Samples of test taker responses at B1, B2 and C1 were collected as well as comments from
         the Language Testing division of Pearson. The ratings on each response include a machine
         score and scores from at least two human raters. In cases where the two human rater
         scores differed, an adjudicator was used to provide a third human rating.


         Scoring


         The Describe image item is scored on 3 different traits:

         Comment on response



         The response lacks some of the main contents. Only some obvious information from the
         graph is addressed. Numerous hesitations, non-native-like pronunciation, poor language
         use and limited control of grammar structures at times make the response difficult to
         understand.


         How the response was scored



         The table below and subsequent tables under ‘How the response was scored’ show the
         machine scores and the human ratings that have been assigned to this response. When the
         cells in the adjudicator column are empty, the adjudicator score does not deviate from the
         scores given by the first and second human rater.

         Comment on response


         The test taker discusses some aspects of the graph and the relationship between elements,
         though some key points have not been addressed. The rate of speech is acceptable.
         Language use and vocabulary range are quite weak. There are some obvious grammar
         errors and inappropriate stress and pronunciation.

         The test taker discusses the major aspects of the graph and the relationship between
         elements. The response is spoken at a fluent rate and language use is appropriate. There
         are few grammatical errors in the response. The candidate demonstrates a wide range of
         vocabulary. Stress is appropriately placed.

         As shown from the scoring tables on the responses presented, the human ratings at trait
         level differed up to two score points out of six possible scoring categories (0 - 5). The two
         graphs below show the level of agreement of the total item score (sum of traits) of the

         human raters (graph on the left) and the agreement of the machine score with the average
         of the human ratings (graph on the right). The total item scores are rendered as a
         proportion of the total maximum item score (15) for the item. The human ratings vary
         substantially, especially for the B2 candidate, from a score that is only slightly higher than
         the score given to the B1 test taker, to a score that is close to the one given to the C1 test
         taker.

















         Note that these ratings were given by trained raters who had all recently passed a rater’s
         exam. This example is therefore not typical for the human rating in general, but it shows
         that in some instances, especially for spoken responses, human raters have a hard time
         deciding on the most fitting score.

         The automatic scoring system that has been trained on more than 100 human raters agrees
         quite well with the average human rating as shown in the graph on the right.

         The machine-human comparison is part of the validation studies based on the field test
         responses for speaking, where 450,000 spoken responses were collected and scored,
         generating more than 1 million human ratings. The correlation between the human raw

         scores and the machine-generated scores for the overall measure of speaking was 0.89. In
         order to neutralize the effect of differences in severity amongst human raters, the human
         scores were scaled using Item Response Theory (IRT). The correlation with the machine
         scores then increases to 0.96. The reliability of the measure of speaking in PTE Academic is
         0.91.

         Written samples


         The PTE Academic automated scoring system correlates highly with average human ratings.
         Studies were carried out to compare human and machine scores for the writing item type
         Write essay, using tasks such as the example below.




         Example Write essay item ‘Tobacco’

















         From the studies using these items, samples of test taker responses at B1, B2 and C1 are
         given as well as a comment from the Language Testing division of Pearson. Ratings on each
         response are provided including a machine score and scores from at least two human
         raters. In cases where the two human rater scores differed, an adjudicator was used to
         provide a third human rating.

         Scoring



         The item type Write essay is scored on 7 different traits:

         Traits                    Maximum raw score          Human rating              Machine score

         The form and spelling traits do not require human ratings for training the automatic scoring
         systems as they can be objectively scored. It can be assumed (if the human raters work
         error-free) that the human rating on these two traits would have been identical to the
         machine score.

         Test taker A: mid B1 Level



         Tobacco, mainly in the form of cigarettes, is one of the most widely-used drugs in the world. Over
         a billion adults legally smoke tobacco everyday. Recently, it is not only the adult. Even the high
         school students or college students smoke just because they want to know how it feels. It is also
         not limited by gender. Lots of women are smokers. Even the old people still smoke, as if they do
         not care about their healthy. Become a smoker is like make someone just care about the good
         feeling of smoking and makes them to forget the risks they will face in the future. The long term
         health costs are high - for smokers themselves, and for the wider community in temrs of health
         care costs and lost productivity. The worst risk that the smokers will face is lung cancer, which can
         cause death. The governments have a legitimate role to legislate to protect citizens from the

         harmful effects of their own decisions to smoke. For example they make rule about no smoking
         area, in the street, and public place. But it also the decisions of each individual wheter they want
         to continue their life as a smoker and take all the risk, or stop and learn to life healthier. (211

         Comment on response



         The response is a simple essay which gives a minimal answer to the question. The argument
         contains insufficient supporting ideas. The structure is lacking in logic and coherence. There
         is frequent misuse of grammar and vocabulary. Vocabulary range is limited and
         inappropriate at times.

         In my opinion it should be a combined effort of both government and an individual. In some
         countries specially in UK, government is tring to impose laws and regulations which discourage
         smoking, for example the law which prohibits smoking in pubs, bars and public areas. Also there
         are TV commercials and banners which explain the long term effects of smoking. As a result there
         has been some reduction in the number of people smoking before the law and now. But this
         effort is not enough. Uptil and unless an individual doesnt makes an effort himself the problem
         cannot be solved. One has to have control of his own body and will power to over come this habit
         turned necessity of the body. There has been a significant increase in amount of people who are
         approching mediacl practioners and NHS to help them to overcome this problem. There are also
         some NGO’s who are working in this field. \n\nI think if we can spread awarness about the ill
         effects of smoking to teenagers, there will be less number of people who start smoking at the first
         place. It is a collective responsibilty of government and parents as well. To conclude i can say that
         youngsters are the people who get facinated by the whole idea of smoking, thus this concept
         should be changed by the efforts of government, media and by us as an individual. (234 words)


         Comment on response


         A systematic argument with appropriate highlighting of significant points and relevant
         supporting detail has been developed. Ability to evaluate different ideas or solutions to a
         problem has been demonstrated. However, some obvious grammar errors and
         inappropriate use of vocabulary can be found. There are also quite a number of spelling
         errors.

         Outlawing tobacco use would create unprecedented controversy. Billions of people worldwide
         smoke; whether they are chain smokers or recreational smokers. Also, there are several multi-
         million dollar cigarette companies that will also suffer many consequences if tobacco use is made
         illegal. We must also consider the thousands of employees who will be left unemployed if such a
         legislation is made. Unfortunately, it is an industry that makes ridiculous amounts of money for
         many people, so the likelihood of banning it is minimal.

         Nonetheless, it is a change that would benefit society on many levels in the long run. Smoking
         causes so many health care issues, so if smoking is made illegal, morbidity and mortality rates
         would be reduced significantly. Quality of life will be improved dramatically, and it will allow
         more people to enjoy their lives significantly longer.

         Legislators must also consider the rights of the individual. Should’nt every individual have the
         right to choose how they treat their body? The government can argue that these individuals may
         do as they wish, but then they must also suffer the consequences without government funding.
         They must take full responsibility for any health issues developed as a result of tobacco use, and
         not expect medicare or health insurance to cover costs caused by their own irresponsible
         negligent decisions.

         In essence, if individuals wish to make their own decisions to smoke, they must consider all the
         possible outcomes, and be willing to deal with these outcomes accordingly. (243 words)


         Comment on response


         Clear, well-structured exposition on the topic which touches upon the relevant issues. Points
         of view are given at some length with subsidiary points. Reasons and relevant examples are

         demonstrated. General linguistic range and vocabulary range are excellent. Phrasing and
         word choice is appropriate. There are very few grammar errors. Spelling is excellent.

         As can be seen from the scoring tables on the essay responses, the machine scores
         correspond closely to the average human score. Although there is some variation at the trait
         level, the total item scores agree to a high degree. To illustrate this agreement the graph
         below shows the machine scores and the average human scores.

         The graph illustrates the total (proportional) item score from the machine and from the
         human ratings for the essay responses. The results show that the machine generated total
         item scores are closely aligned with the average over the human ratings.


















         The machine-human comparison is part of the validation studies based on the field test
         responses for writing, where 50,000 written responses were collected and scored,
         generating about 0.6 million human ratings.

         The correlation between the human raw scores and the machine-generated scores for the

         overall measure of writing was 0.88. In order to neutralize the effect of differences in
         severity amongst human raters, the human scores were scaled using IRT. The correlation
         with the machine scores then increases to 0.93. The reliability of the measure of writing in
         PTE Academic is 0.89.
